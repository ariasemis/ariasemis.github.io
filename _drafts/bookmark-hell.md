taming the web??

first is that there are different reasons for using a bookmark, and they have different needs, bookmarks end up being a one-size fits all kind of solution, not specially good for any of the uses. When all you have is a hammer...

also they are also all spread in many places: pocket, starred in feedly, saved posts in HN or reddit, watch later in youtube, etc.

use cases:

## articles, papers, essays, ...

the first thing I think about when thinking about bookmarks

articles that I keep coming back 

what I want: local backup for when the site goes down, organize with labels or tags, able to add annotations, full text search, ... basically a knowledge based tool

what I tried: currently using worldbrain memex, althought still looking for alternatives because it currently doesn't backup the site and also seems that it doesn't support pages from the web archive

## temporary stuff

sometimes you find an article that seems promising but just dont have time to read it at the moment, other times you are working in something and need to keep at hand a bunch of resources that will help with the task but are no longer needed once its finished...

I guess that this was the scenario that pocket tried to fix, but it just doesn't work for me.

what i want: easy access, groups or categories, easy removal, maybe even automatically removal after some time??

what i tried: for these I just decided to use browser tabs and leave opened everything I want to track temporarily. In order to improve a little this, I'm looking into using an extension like TreeStyleTabs that automatically groups tabs from a common origin and lets me rearrange them however I like

## feeds and subscriptions

sometimes you find an author you want to keep up with, the first approach is to just bookmark their site and visit it regularly to see if there is some new post

a better approach is to subscribe to its RSS/atom feed or newsletter and be notified about updates

I tried these, but I found that this also doesn't work for me

instead I found Fraidycat which works the way I want it

## tools, resources, ...

I'm thinking of stuff like documentation, asset galleries, web-based tools, platforms, communities...

while the fastest way to access this kind of thing would be to just type in the address bar, sometimes I want to use something I dont remember its url or name

what I want: shortcuts, some kind of index page of the saved resources/tools, that I can organize by tags or categories, nothing fancy

this is the only scenario I'm still just using bookmarks, as I can organize them in folders and keep them at hand, there is not much that I need anyway
