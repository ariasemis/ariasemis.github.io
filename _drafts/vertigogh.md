A while ago, during an attack, I thought to myself that if what Van Gogh had was Meniere's, then I'd understand why did he cut off his own ear.

Then I stumbled upon this:

This sparked my curiosity so I decided to do a little search.

It turns out that some people have already suggested that Van Gogh may have actually suffered from Meniere's disease, but was misdiagnosed due to it not being well known at the time. Wow.

Of course, like with any of the other hypotheses, there is no way to prove it. 

did this contribute to his unique artistic vision?
