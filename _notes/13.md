```
Perfect Pitch Puzzle - Song #113 1/6 - Piano 游꿫 游꿧
游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴
```

tried another [little game](https://www.perfectpitchpuzzle.com/), this time themed around music

I only realized there was a harder mode after I beat the first puzzle, 
but luckily I was just minutes away from a new one

```
Perfect Pitch Puzzle - Song #114 1/6 in HARD mode - Piano 游꿫 游꿧
游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴
```

keep in mind that I know nothing about music and was still able to solve it on the first try

so it may still be quite easy for a "hard" mode

if I ever revisit it, I may try changing the instrument as that may make it a bit harder
