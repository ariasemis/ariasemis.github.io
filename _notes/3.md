in the first post in this blog I wrote

> I spend a lot of time thinking things through. But I’m not used to taking notes. Then all those ideas, which seemed so clear at the moment, start to fade. At the end, I forget most of it.

> I want to change that. I want this to be a place where I can write down those thoughts. To understand them better. To clear my mind of clutter. And hopefully gain some insight.

of course, that didn’t work out, so I tried to change my strategy, thinking that

> Maybe it was too big of a leap for me and instead I should have started small. That’s why I created this space. A bit hidden from plain sight so that I feel more comfortable with less refined work.
> 
> The idea is to post short and quick notes of half-finished thoughts. No formatting, no editing, no pressure.

and yet here we are, ~2 years later, and not a single entry (in any form) was added since those first ones

until now, I guess, which probably makes most of the content on this site to be just me complaining about not being able to write for $#*!

can’t say I didn’t see it coming, I mean, I even said so in that very first blog post

> It could go the other way. Releasing to the public is scary. And it’s already hard enough to put my thoughts into words in my own language. All this friction may end up working against me.

but third time’s the charm, so here I am, once again, refusing to surrender
