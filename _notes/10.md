ðŸŽ¨ I painted the Mona Lisa with 77.2% accuracy!

at least according to this [fun game](https://vole.wtf/clone-a-lisa/) where you are tasked with painting a forgery in under a minute

it's not the first game Iâ€™ve played where you are encouraged to share and compete with your friends instead of having a leaderboard

but of them all, I think this one works the best in that regard

thereâ€™s just something about sharing your poor attempt at a drawing that makes it much more compelling to share than just trying to figure out a single correct answer

and while there are some ways to trick the game into giving you higher scores

that also helps to inspire players into being creative and experiment with their paintings

I think a more accurate scoring system would probably just worsen the experience
