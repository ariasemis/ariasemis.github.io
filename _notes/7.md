the 2002 fifa world cup is the first cup that I can recall actually watching, and yet, there is little I remember about it

whether that’s because I was pretty young at the time or just cause (despite my nationality) I’ve never been that much into football, I can only guess

there is one thing that I do remember though, and that is [the music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzT5_EQkpOk)

what am I even trying to say?

I’m not sure

just thinking how crazy it was that [alfredo casero got to sing 島唄 in front of a japanese crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NmQ0x1l0Og)
