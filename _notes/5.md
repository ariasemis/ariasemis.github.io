I came across this [tool](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) today while browsing github recommendations

in the past I used a similar one to create my github profile, something you already know as it’s one of the only things I wrote about here

anyway, keeping the data displayed up to date was one of the biggest pain points, which is funny considering that is the main reason I liked the idea in the first place,

and so now I’m tempted to update it and use this app instead

it already integrates with [github actions](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs-action) and has the killer feature of re-playing recorded sessions

basically, it makes everything I did before obsolete lol
