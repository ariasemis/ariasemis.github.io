I am glad that I added these notes. I like the idea. I must admit is not something I came up with by myself though.

First there is the idea of building a ["Digital Garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) out of small raw thoughts that grow and are polished over time.

Also the guys at the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) seem to promote a similar concept. And with webmentions on top, they add a new dimention to it.

I think there's a lot of potential with this.
