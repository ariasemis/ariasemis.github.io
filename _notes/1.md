I rarely write on this blog. 
Or to be more precise, I rarely _publish_ on this blog.

Because I have written some stuff. I discarded it. Writing is hard, editing is harder. I'm never happy with the results, so it never sees the light of day.

Not that I'm happy with whatever I did published, mind you.

Maybe it was too big of a leap for me and instead I should have started small.
That's why I created this space. 
A bit hidden from plain sight so that I feel more comfortable with less refined work.

The idea is to post short and quick notes of half-finished thoughts. No formatting, no editing, no pressure.

I really hope it works.
