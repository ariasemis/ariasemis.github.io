  Well, there's no much code involved, if at all. At least from my side. I just wired some tools together to make it work with the blog.

  - [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) for capturing and parsing incoming mentions
  - [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/) for sending notifications to other sites
  - And [integromat](https://www.integromat.com/) to do all the wiring
