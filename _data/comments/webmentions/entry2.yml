  Oh I guess I should give a quick explanation of what webmentions are.

  Basically, is a protocol for a website to notify another one that it has linked to it. Yes, like pingbacks. 

  The difference is that, with some metadata in place, the receiver can get some more context about the link: was it a reply or a repost? maybe a reaction?

  Also the receiver can decide what to do with it. You can display it however you want, from a list of comments, a bunch of faces or just the links. And of course there is no requirement to even display them in the first place, you could use them for private notifications as well.

  Pretty cool, right?
