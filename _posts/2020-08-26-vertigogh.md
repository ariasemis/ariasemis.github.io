A while ago, during an attack, I thought to myself that if what Van Gogh had was Meniere's, then I'd understand why did he cut off his own ear.

Recently I stumbled upon this:

This sparked my curiosity so I decided to do a little search on the topic.

It turns out that some people have already suggested that Van Gogh may have actually suffered from Meniere's disease, but was misdiagnosed due to it not being well known at the time. Wow.

There're other theories as well: epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, drugs, etc. Doctors have been debating over this for ages. But with no way to prove any of them it doesn't seem like we'll ever know the truth.
