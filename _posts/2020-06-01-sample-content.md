## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

> Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

<cite>Steve Jobs, Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference, 1997</cite>

## Address element

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

## Preformatted element

This element styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
	margin: 0 0 5px;
	font-weight: bold;
	font-size: 38px;
	line-height: 1.2;
	and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE element handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

```js
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console


// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments

var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function

adder(2, 6);
// > 8
```
